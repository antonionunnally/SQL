Sample Data
Media related data was created using real data from an iTunes Library. Sales information was auto generated using random data over a four year period. Customer and employee information were manually created using fictitious names, addresses that can be located on Google maps, as well as postal_code,email, phone, fax.

Background
The name chinook is based on the Northwind database. Chinooks are winds in the interior West of North America, where the Canadian Prairies and Great Plains meet various mountain ranges. Chinooks are most prevalent over southern Alberta in Canada. The chinook database was created as an alternative to the Northwind data.
