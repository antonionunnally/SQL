# Antonio Nunnally's SQL Portfolio
Hello, and Welcome to my SQL Portfolio! This code repository contains examples of SQL I've written for solo projects and while working through SQL. 
Below are a few highlighted projects, feel free to take a look and reach out by on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonionunnally) or by [email](nunnally_a@yahoo.com) if you have any feedback or questions. 

## Highlighted Projects
**Spotify Top Songs Analaysis** - [SQL](https://github.com/antonionunnally/SQL/tree/main/Spotify%20Analytics): In this project, I used a dataset found on Kaggle to analyze trends in the top 50 songs of 2021. Using pitch-class integer notation, I examined the key and tonality for these top songs. I joined data from a Hooktheory database to compare the most popular song keys with the song keys most represented in the top 50 Spotify tracks of 2021.

**Pizza Sales** - [SQL](https://github.com/antonionunnally/SQL/tree/main/Pizza%20Sales): In this project, I used a dataset from Maven Analytics on a year's worth of sales data from a fictitious pizza place. The data included the date and time of each order and the pizzas served, along with additional details on the type, size, quantity, price, and ingredients.
