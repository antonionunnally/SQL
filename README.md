### **Spotify Top Songs Analaysis** 
- [SQL](https://github.com/antonionunnally/SQL/tree/main/Spotify%20Analytics): 
In this project, I used a dataset found on Kaggle to analyze trends in the top 50 songs of 2021. Using pitch-class integer notation, I examined the key and tonality for these top songs. I joined data from a Hooktheory database to compare the most popular song keys with the song keys most represented in the top 50 Spotify tracks of 2021.

### **Pizza Sales** 
- [SQL](https://github.com/antonionunnally/SQL/tree/main/Pizza%20Sales): In this project, I used a dataset from Maven Analytics on a year's worth of sales data from a fictitious pizza place. The data included the date and time of each order and the pizzas served, along with additional details on the type, size, quantity, price, and ingredients.

### **Danny’s Diner** 
- [SQL]([https://github.com/antonionunnally/SQL/tree/main/Pizza%20Sales](https://github.com/antonionunnally/SQL/tree/main/Danny's_Diner_SQL_Case_Study): In this project, I used a dataset from Danny's Dinner. Danny’s Diner is in need of your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat — the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.
